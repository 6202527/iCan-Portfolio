          This was made near the beginning of this year. This was made with Blender.

          I made everything myself except for the barrels

          This was really fun to make, I prefer this one over the sword.

          It was also fun to make but I prefer the hammer as it had more details.

          I think this one might be my favorite thing I've made with Blender this year. It was the most time consuming one we have made this year.

          This was made before Winter break. This was made with Tinker
        </p>
        <p>
          It was simple but I never really used tinker before this, we had to choose what tutorial we followed, and the Pirate ship looked the best in my opinion

          I won't lie, I didn't enjoy making this one, I found it boring and too easy.

          We had to make a fantasy map. I found a paintbrush with a bunch of little decoration (All the little drawings on the map), that I decided to use.
